            <h6> Assistant General Manager/Shift Lead/Server/Wait Assistant/Bar Back/Bartender,
            Summer 2016, January to December 2017 </h6>
            <p>In my time at Eat Street Social, I held many positions, the highest of which being Assistant General Manager. I learned a great deal here in addition to bringing a lot of valuable skills to the table. I gained a solid skillset as a bar team member, developing a strong knowledge of spirits and classic cocktails, while having the opportunity to flex my creativity and develop original cocktails. I was also able to hone my craft as a server to a very high level, and would describe myself as a Rockstar server. I gradually took on more and more responsibility as a shift lead, until I was eventually promoted to the role of AGM. As AGM, I led the front of house team and it’s interfacing with the back of house. I spent time bartending, cooking on the line during service, washing dishes, serving, and anything else that was needed. I assisted with scheduling, product ordering, menu changes, employee interviewing and testing, performance reviews, and employee termination. I also assisted with private event sales and coordination, marketing and graphic design, and public event planning.</p></li>
